    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am Arthur Lee, a former professional gamer, who turned into a student for Epicodus!
      I traveled the world playing video games for 2 years of my life and lived my childhood dream.
      During that time I started coding as well and realized I enjoyed it!
      I coded a lot on my free time wanted to learn more. So then, I retired from professional gaming to study at
      Epicodus hoping to make it into a career!
